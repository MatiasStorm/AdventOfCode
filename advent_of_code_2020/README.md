# Advent Of Code 2020
Here are my solutions to the advent of code puzzles. 
I have written an indepth post on how I solved each puzzle over on my website [matiasstorm.com](https://matiasstorm.com).

## Scripts
The scripts used to solve the puzzles for each day are located in a folder 
named after the date (i.e december 1st is in folder `1`).
